So as you may have seen in the footer I'm using Hexo as my static page generator. In this first proper post I'm going to share what a breeze it was to get it done.

# Preliminary thoughts
## Why static?
- small, unbloated
- easy to back up
- easy to move

## Why Hexo?
- looked into some, felt like the right choice
- ticks all the necessary boxes (see above)
- nice cli

# 
## Getting the page ready
### Step 0
- npm
- git

### Step 1
- install hexo
- init page and add git (partly optional. generally nice to have but very convenient with vercel)

### Step 1.1
- choose theme or plugin(s)

## Connecting it to the web
### Step 2
- push it to git server
### Step 3
- Connect it to vercel
#### Web
#### CLI

### Step 3.1
- custom domain

And there you go. An easy and lightweight blog.
