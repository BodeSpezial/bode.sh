When you work on software you should at least use some sort of versioning. When I think back at the work I did in a company where IT was still some king of black wizardry we just made a copy of the project every few days. That is obviously  completely inefficient but partly determined by the tools we uesd and at least we had some kind of backup in the case of a total screw-up. So if you write code in a normal sense you will hace the possibility to store your code in some sort of versioning system and you absolutely should! Maybe I should talk about the pros of that in another article... But today I assume that you already use a versioning system. In my case it is git and this article will be targeted to it. So if you use another system the overall gist might still help you but a lot of the commandd differ probably.

Todays topic will be the usage of tags in git, how to use them to track releases in your repository and how to implement github releases with you tags.
