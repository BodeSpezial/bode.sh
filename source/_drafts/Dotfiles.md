I quite like to customise everything I need to use longer than 5 minutes. And since I sit and stand quite some time in front of my computer it's just natural, that I'm almost constantly tweaking my configurations. And my curiosity always brings new topics or tools into my mind so that I always have something new and fancy to dig through.

So I decided to start a series of posts in which I write about the tools I like and use and how I configured them and why. I can't promise that the next posts will all be about that. I see it more like a parachute if I really don't know what to write in a month or just if I feel like it.
That said I also don't know how much posts this series will contain. It'll probably be more of an open list. I'll start with the things I currently use and if I should stumble across something new that I like I'll add it.

Now.
On to the first tool in my belt:

# Stow
I think stow is quite a good starting point because it helps you deal with all the other tools I'm going to talk about sooner or later.

A little disclaimer: I myself use stow only for a short time so it is totally possible, that I made some mistakes or that I understood something wrong. If you've found something wrong just hit me up through one of my contact methods, I'm happy to learn something I missed.
